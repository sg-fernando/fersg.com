## 🚀 Project Structure

The site structure and Astro setup was based on the [Build your first Astro Blog](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) tutorial.
Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
fersg.com/
│
├── public/            # Static assets (images, fonts, icons)
├── src/
│   ├── components/    # Reusable components (Header, Footer, Navigation, Social)
│   ├── pages/         # Pages (index.astro, experience.astro, projects.astro)
│   └── layouts/       # Optional layout components
├── package.json       # Project metadata and dependencies
└── astro.config.mjs   # Astro configuration
```



To learn more about the folder structure of an Astro project, refer to the [guide on project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).
